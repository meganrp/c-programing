1. How to print out a byte from a file in binary? (Possible Rabbit hole )

1A. How to 

2. How to read next byte from file? 
By using a loop, we check with feof(ptr). Then read each byte into the buffer. 

     while(feof(ptr) == 0) {
        fread(&buffer, sizeof(buffer), 1, ptr); 
        printf("read one byte, hopefully\n"); 
    }

3. How to know when we reach end of file? 
We know we reach end of file using feof(ptr) just like above. 

4. How to read each bit inside a byte?
