input: 2 (how many bytes have the sequence of 2 (1's)) 


10110110  - 2
10110110  - 4
10110110  - 6

Output: 6 

OR 

(Is there a sequence of 2 (1's)) 

we found a sequence of two inside and we will just return 2 


Input: 2 

11101111

11011011


Binary Number: 11111010
Checking pairs
============== 
Sequence Counter: (4 / input) = output  

Input: 2

[11101110]

if the sequenceCounter = numSequence then add 1 to output AND reset sequenceCounter to 0  (reset when it hits 0 as well)


Output: 2
